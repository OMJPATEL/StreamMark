## General Description
 
StreamMark is a React-based project that allows users to explore different types of content lists (movies, educational, fun facts, music).
Each component is independently developed by a team member and then rendered together to demonstrate list rendering in React.
 
The goal of the project is to practice list rendering, component modularity, and collaborative development in React while providing a simple
interactive experience.
 
## User Stories
 
1. As a user, I want to view multiple categorized content lists (movies, educational, fun facts, music) so that I can easily explore different
categories in one place.
 
2. As a user, I want each list to contain several items so that I can quickly scan and learn from the information provided.
 
3. As a user, I want each list to be styled consistently and neatly so that the application looks professional and is easy to navigate.
